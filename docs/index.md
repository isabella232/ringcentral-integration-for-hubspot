# Getting Started

RingCentral has 3 HubSpot Integrations:

1. **[Marketplace App](marketplace-app):** This is an integration that supports the pre-defined functionaly specified by the HubSpot CTI Framework. Overall, it provides a smooth integration but is limited in functionality to what the CTI Framework supports. It is calld the App Marketplace integration because it is installed via the HubSpot App Marketplace here. [Get the HubSpot App Marketplace app via the RingCentral App Gallery](https://www.ringcentral.com/apps/call-with-ringcentral-for-hubspot)
2. **[Chrome Browser Extension](browser-extension):** The Chrome Extension integration is a Chrome extension that provides a richer set of functionality for Chrome browser users. This extension needs to be installed in Chrome using the Extension Manager. [Get the HubSpot Chrome Extension via the RingCentral App Gallery](https://www.ringcentral.com/apps/hubspot)
3. **[Firefox Add-on](browser-extension):** This is similar to the Chrome Browser Extension.

The Marketplace App and Browser Extensions behave slightly differently and have different features.
