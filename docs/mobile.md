## Mobile Device Management

### Can I get the Android APK for my Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution?

Many MDMs can directly manage apps from the Google Play store so an APK isn't necessary. See this link for how to do this with [IBM MaaS360](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8H2S/com.ibm.mc.doc/pag_source/tasks/pag_apps_add_google_play.htm). If you still have questions, please contact RingCentral support.
